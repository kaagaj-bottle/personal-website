**Hey there! I&apos;m Zishan Siddique, a computer engineering student currently in my fourth year at Purwanchal Campus.**

**About My Field**  
My journey into the world of technology has been a blend of exploration and curiosity. With a knack for full-stack development, my skills in React and Node.js have allowed me to craft dynamic and user-centric web experiences. While I might say I&apos;m good at none and okay at many things.  
Beyond the realm of coding, I have a deep-seated fascination with the realms of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The allure of these fields lies in their ability to harness data and algorithms to create intelligent systems that can shape the future.

**About Myself**    
My interests extend beyond the digital landscape; I&apos;m an avid reader, drawn to the philosophies of Albert Camus and Kafka. Their existential insights resonate with my own contemplations about life&apos;s meaning and human existence.  
When I&apos;m not engrossed in code or philosophy, you&apos;ll often find me wandering the city streets, taking in the rhythm and energy of urban life. There&apos;s something incredibly grounding about simply walking and observing the ebb and flow of the cityscape.

**About This Website**  
This website is a reflection of my journey, a place where I hope to share insights, experiences, and perhaps a snippet of inspiration for fellow enthusiasts, learners, and curious minds. Join me as I navigate the intersections of technology, philosophy, and the beauty of simply exploring the world around us.

**And**  
Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or simply share your thoughts. Let&apos;s connect and explore together!
